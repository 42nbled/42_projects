This project involves creating three distinct programs, each demonstrating different aspects of self-replicating code in C, C++ and assembly.
• The first program, "Colleen," must print its own source code, including comments and a separate function. • • The second, "Grace," generates its own source code in a separate file without declaring a main function, using macros and defines.
• The third program, "Sully," writes its source code to a new file, compiles it, and executes it, with the integer value in the source decrementing with each execution.
The goal is to practice self-replicating code and macros while following specific constraints on how each program is structured and executed.
