# Common Core
These projects were undertaken as part of the Common Core at **42**, covering foundational software development and problem-solving skills. Each project presented a unique challenge, ranging from creating custom libraries (e.g., libft, get_next_line) to developing complex applications like a multi-threaded philosopher problem (Philosophers) and a raycasting engine (cub3D). All of these helped reinforce expertise in C programming and low-level system understanding.
